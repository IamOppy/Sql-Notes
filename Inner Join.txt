Inner Join finds an intersection of two datasets based on a link and returns a subset.
a.emp_no = b.emp_no

SELECT a.emp_no, CONCAT(a.first_name, a.last_name) as "name", b.salary 
FROM employees as a, salaries as b WHERE a.emp_no = b.emp_no

SELECT a.emp_no, CONCAT(a.first_name, a.last_name) as "name", b.salary 
FROM employees as a 
INNER JOIN salaries as b ON b.emp_no = a.emp_no    

when you do a join, make sure you ORDER BY the emp_no.


pattern:
	SELECT a.emp_no,
		 CONCAT(a.first_name, a.last_name) as "name",
		 b.salary,
		 c.title,
		 c.from_date AS "promoted on"
	FROM employees AS a
	INNER JOIN salaries AS b ON a.emp_no = b.emp_no
	INNER JOIN titles AS c ON c.emp_no = a.emp_no  
	AND (b.from_date = c.from_date OR 
	(b.from_date + interval '2 days') = c.from_date)

	ORDER BY a.emp_no
